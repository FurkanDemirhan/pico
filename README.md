# Pico thing
this project is in an early state i dont even have name for it XD
i am using circuitpython with 16mb flash pico and i am using joysticks to use menu
and oldui.py uses terminalio i am no longer using that file
i n this project i use buzzer, 1 joystick(i have a second one too but i havent added a code for it), one HCSR04 An 128x64 SSD1306 Oled Screen and an random rgb led (and i will also add 4x4 matrix pad later)
